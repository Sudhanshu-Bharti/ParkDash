## Idea/Approach Details :
**(1) Providing Optimal Pricings :**<br> By using Deep Q-Networks (DQN) or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithms to adaptively optimize pricing strategies by engaging with the parking environment, responding to rewards tied to revenue and occupancy rates, all in real-time.<br>

**(2) Admin-User Authentication System :**<br>
Introducing an Admin-User Review System to ensure accountability from both sides. Users can provide feedback on admin-listed parking spaces also allowing the administrators to monitor user activity, resolve disputes, and maintain a fair and transparent parking ecosystem. Hence, enhancing the overall experience by helping others find convenient parking spots.<br>

**(3) Privacy :**<br> To enhance user privacy, integrate privacy-preserving algorithms, blockchain for secure record-keeping, identity management, zero-knowledge proofs, and tokenization. Use multi-factor authentication, and secure communications. Implement consent management platforms, and end-to-end encryption, and conduct regular. These tools and practices will safeguard user data and foster trust in our Application.<br>

**(4) ALPR (Automatic License Plate Recognition) Technology :**<br>Integrating ALPR technology with CCTV cameras enhances our parking management system's efficiency and security. These strategically placed cameras capture license plate images, while our ALPR software processes them in real-time, swiftly recognizing license plate data. To further elevate the user experience, we've introduced a QR code feature for quick payments. Upon exit, a unique QR code is generated, allowing users to make instant payments with a smartphone scan. This innovation simplifies the payment process and exemplifies our commitment to efficiency and user convenience.<br>

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Features🌟
**(1) Advance Booking & Time Extension:** Users can plan ahead by reserving parking spots, reducing the hassle of finding parking. Our system also allows easy time extension, ensuring flexibility and a stress-free parking experience.<br>

**(2) Geolocation with Google API:** Our system leverages the Google Geolocation API to provide accurate location services. Users can effortlessly pinpoint available parking spots, optimizing their search and reducing unnecessary congestion. This feature streamlines parking, making it both efficient and user-friendly<br>

**(3) Parking Tier Diversification & Emergency Parking:** ur system categorizes parking spots into tiers (Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3) based on factors such as the availability of security guards, CCTV surveillance, and other amenities, offering varying pricing options following DQN algorithm. Also, we provide dedicated emergency parking spaces, greatly enhancing safety and providing users with invaluable flexibility.<br>

**(4) EV Parking Support:** Observing the increasing popularity of EVs ,we are providing special support for electric vehicles (EVs) with reduced pricing and reservation options, making parking convenient and cost-effective for EV users.<br>

## Show Stoppers
 **[1] Image Reporting and Community Accountability:** Our system allows users to report illegal parking by uploading images. To maintain accountability, we introduce a "Community Tab" where users can vote (like/dislike) on reported images. This collective voting system increases or decreases a user's rating based on the accuracy of their reports, fostering responsible reporting and community participation in upholding parking standards.<br>

 **[2] Geolocation with Google API:** Our system leverages the Google Geolocation API to provide accurate location services. Users can effortlessly pinpoint available parking spots, optimizing their search and reducing unnecessary congestion. This feature streamlines parking, making it both efficient and user-friendly<br>
 
 **[3] Sensor Technology and QR Code Payment Integration:** We employ sensor technology at entry and exit points to streamline parking. As vehicles enter and exit, sensors detect their presence, automatically recording entries and exits. Also, we’ve integrated QR code support for swift payments. Users receive a QR code upon exit, which they can easily scan with their smartphones for instant payment processing.<br>
